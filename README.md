This was my first attempt to build a personal website/blog. I tried to get out of my comfort zone and use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a zero-JavaScript approach.

I have nothing against `Hugo`. And I believe it is a great tool for building static websites. However, It was not my cup of coffee. (or, probably, I went too far outside my comfort zone, using SCSS and no JS.)

To use this. [Install](https://gohugo.io/installation/) Hugo then run:

```sh
hugo serve
```
