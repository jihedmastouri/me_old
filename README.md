This my first try of building a personal website. I tried to get out of my comfort zone and use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Zero-JavaScript apporach.

I have nothing against `Hugo` and I believe it's a great tool for building Static website. But It was not my cup of coffee. Or Probably I went too far outside my comfort zone with my other decisions.

This was base on an amazing Hugo Theme: [Winston](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme).

Sorry For butchering your Theme bro ðŸ˜…
